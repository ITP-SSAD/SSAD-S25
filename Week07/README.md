# Week 7

## Task: Circular Buffer

- Build the circular buffer, a **template class** that supports the functions: **push**, **empty**, **size**, and **pop** (**pop** should return a value), .
- Build a custom **forward iterator** for the circular buffer. The iterator should allow iterating over the circular buffer elements in a circular fashion, meaning after reaching the end, it starts from the beginning again.
- Use **std::vector** for simplicity.
