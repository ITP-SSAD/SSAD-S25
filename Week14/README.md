# Week 14

## Task 1 - Command

You are given the structure of a simplified command application that processes access requests. Your task is to complete the implementation and explore extending the chain with new handlers.

## Task 2 - Chain of Responsibility

You are given the template of the code. Your task is to complete the implementation and explore extending the chain with new handlers.

- Implement handlers for different checks, such as a authentication, role check and throttling handlers that limits requests.
- Enhance the client interaction to allow dynamic input and testing of different requests.
- Test and refine the behavior of each handler to ensure the chain operates correctly across various scenarios.

## Task 3 - Observer

You are given a basic framework of an Observer pattern implementation, which involves an editor that notifies listeners about file operations like opening and saving files.

- Complete the missing methods in the EventManager and Editor classes.
- Create at least two listeners that perform different actions when notified.
- Write a demo class to demonstrate the functionality of your implemented Observer pattern.
