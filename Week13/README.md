## Task 1 - Interpreter

1. You are to build an interpreter for mathematical expressions.
   1. Classes to build: the numerical expression, multiplication expression, addition expression, subtraction expression.
   1. Imagine the parser is built for you.
   1. Use the interpreter design pattern to evaluate a given expression.
   1. Demonstrate the usage in the main function.

## Task 2 - Iterator

1. Build a class representing a directed tree.
1. Each node A should have a list of neighbors (nodes which node A has a direct edge to).
1. Build an iterator to traverse in DFS fashion.

Hint: use stack.

## Task 3 - Visitor

The starter code represents an online store which has three products: books, tea, and coffee. There is a discount applied to coffee and tea for book readers.
