# Week 12

## Task 1 - Bridge

A music streaming app needs to be designed with music players that can play music of different genres such as pop, and jazz. Additionally, the app should support different audio codecs such as MP3, and WAV.

1. Identify the abstraction, implementation, refined abstractions, and concrete implementations.
1. Use the **Bridge design** **pattern** to redesign the music streaming app.
1. Add a music player for the rock music genre. Also, add an audio codec for FLAC. 

## Task 2 - Flyweight

The given starter code is a painting app that allows to draw shapes. 

1. Identify the expensive objects (which consume a lot of memory)
1. Create **ShapeType** class which implements the **IShape** interface.
1. Complete the code in the **ShapeFactory** class for the objects.
1. Complete this starter code following the **Flyweight design pattern** so that you significantly reduce the amount of memory used.

## Task 3 - Factory

The diagram below represents a **Factory design pattern**. Implement it.
